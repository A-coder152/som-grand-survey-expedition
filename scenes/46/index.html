    <h2> The history of the RAVINE TOMB!!</h2>
    <p> The bottom entrance of the RAVINE TOMB!!! was built 20 years after the discovery of the ravine in the Pheus Era in 1467 A.P. (Annus Pheusus). During the initial discovery of this ravine, it was hauled with precious minerals, like sheckles (what shells are made of), gold, silver, and uranium-235!</p>
    <p> However, while digging for these precious minerals, pheusians found pieces of wood, concrete, and red bricks. These types of objects are near impossible to naturally end up deep in a ravine. </p>
    <p> So the workmen decided to dig deeper towards these 'artifacts' and found a wall. They decied to break in, and found what they could not believe</p>
    <p> A HUGE TREX, chained together, roaring so loud the workers eardrums were on the brink of explosion! They tried to run, but the way they came from got closed off due to rubble and rock :0</p>
    <p> The workers were trapped, in a room where the TREX could reach his head in any corner, since it was unchained. The tools that the workers had were completely eaten by the TREX, and so they had to go to the very edge of the room, and dig with bare hands. Many couldn't make it, but those who escaped had beat a great feat in Pheuskind. </p>

    <h2> The modern era:</h2>
    <p>
  Years later, heidi and explopheus were exploring these abandoned ruins, 
  and were trying to find some sort of fossil that they could build a statue of at the 
  <a href="/scenes/4">Embresa Mesa Museum of Hugs</a>.
    They found the TREX, and were able to take a few pictures and started to carry some of the bones out. but suddenly, the TREX somehow woke up, with just bare bones! and started to chase them. Heidi and Explopheus ran as fast as they could, but the TREX was gaining on them, they couldn't find an exit, and the trex was chasing them from where they came from! Just then, a small glimmer of light, with the exit symbol shining bright, they ran towards it, and jumped through the exit, and landed into the purple gravel surrounding the ravine.
</p>
<p>Just as they thought they barely escaped, they heard a loud explosion, and the trex broke out of the exit. Heidi and Explopheus were done for sure, but they saw something that was red and yellow buried underneath the sand, they unraveled it, and they found a hot air balloon. they quickly added some TCoal (tickle coal) they got from <a href="/scenes/3">The Tickle Tomb</a> and used a firestarter kit to light it up.</p>
<p>Heidi and Explopheus jumped in the balloon, and they started to lift up, but the TREX caught up to them and grabbed a sandbag attached to the basket! Heidi and Explorepheus started screaming, and in a panic they luckily cut the sandbag off, narrowly making it out alive. </p>
