### Landscape & Location

A small green island on the North East tip of the map. 
Located between the alps in the snowy biome, the suculent forests of the mainland and a twin island '_The Land of Obese Plants_'. 

On the land of this island there is a small gravyard of tech relics that have failed to keep up or were never deemed popular enough for widespread attention.
Each grave has a name, picture and discription and links to more information if needed. 
While small in size BLORT is a place of morning for the dead.
