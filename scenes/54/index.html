              This tomb contains the heroic soldiers who bravly defended our
              land from the Trianglish, during the War of the South. Many of
              these soldiers used heat to there advantage, but lots of them were
              wounded in battle, and they couldn't move, burning to death in the
              sun.

              This water fall is connected to Cave Dunowrath, a cave once
              connecting Hotland to 78. The water fall, formed after a fatal
              land slide, destroying villages, and collapsing caves. Now you can
              only get in through, by jumping in the deep underground lake.
